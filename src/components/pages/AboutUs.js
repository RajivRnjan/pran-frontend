              The idea of PRAN came to the light when we faced difficulties
              finding proper notes of respective subjects and PYQs of those
              subjects. We are thinking of resolving this issue then our Founder
              Navin came with the solution and thatâ€™s how PRAN was born. It is
              almost 1.5 years we are runing this website and happend to be in
              all the colleges associated with Vinoba Bhave University.{" "}
